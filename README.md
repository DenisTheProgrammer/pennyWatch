This is what I think will be my 3rd year final project, I will be starting this during the summer and completing it during the university year. This project will be a finance tracking website which will have its own domain and will be hosted on the internet.
During this project, I will be learning how to sharpen my designing and project building skills, along with hosting a website on a public domain for the first time.
